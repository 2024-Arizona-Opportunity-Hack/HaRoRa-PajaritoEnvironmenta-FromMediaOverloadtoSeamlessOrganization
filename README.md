## Inspiration

We’ve observed that many applications offer cloud-based solutions, but their pricing and setup can be prohibitive for non-profit organizations (NPOs) and individuals with limited technical expertise. These standardized solutions are designed for general use, whereas NPOs often have very specific and unique needs. To address this, we aim to explore trade-offs such as utilizing open-source models to minimize infrastructure costs and reduce expenses associated with model usage, making the solution more accessible and tailored for NPOs.

## Problem Statement

Our project aims to streamline and automate efficient media organization using AI. The solution uses content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to automatically tag and organize photos, making it easy to find specific images based on visual content, metadata, and custom tags. The system is integrate with cloud storage, providing a simple interface for uploading, searching, and sharing media files while ensuring robust backup and file management. The ultimate goal is to:

-   improve efficiency
-   provide cost efficient solution
-   reduce manual effort
-   enhance media accessibility for anyone.
